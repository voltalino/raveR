\title{Mix multiple tracks together}
\usage{
mix_tracks(tracks, levels = DEFAULT_MIX_LEVELS)
}
\arguments{
\item{tracks}{Named list of Wave objects. Names should match level names.}

\item{levels}{Named list of level multipliers (0-1). Names should match
track names. Default uses DEFAULT_MIX_LEVELS.}
}
\value{
Combined Wave object. Note: output may exceed the -1 to 1 range if
tracks are loud. Use normalize_mix() after mixing.
}
\description{
Combines multiple Wave objects with level scaling. All tracks
are padded to the same length before mixing.
}
\details{
The mixing process:
\enumerate{
\item Find the maximum length among all tracks
\item Pad shorter tracks with silence to match
\item Multiply each track by its level
\item Sum all tracks together
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
tracks <- list(
  kick = kick_wave,
  bass = bass_wave,
  pad = pad_wave
)
mixed <- mix_tracks(tracks)
normalized <- normalize_mix(mixed)
}
