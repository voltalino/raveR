\title{Normalize Wave for Export}
\usage{
normalize_for_export(wave)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A tuneR Wave object (typically 32-bit float)}
}
\value{
A tuneR Wave object in 16-bit PCM format
}
\description{
Converts a 32-bit internal Wave object to 16-bit PCM format
suitable for WAV file export. This is the final step before
writing audio to disk.
}
\details{
Internal processing uses 32-bit float for headroom during mixing.
WAV export requires 16-bit PCM for maximum compatibility with
audio players. This function performs the conversion using
tuneR::normalize() with unit="16".
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate and normalize for export
wave <- raver_sine(440, 1)
export_wave <- normalize_for_export(wave)
tuneR::writeWave(export_wave, "output.wav")
}
}
