\title{Create a bass line}
\usage{
raver_bass_line(notes, durations, bpm, velocity = 0.9, cutoff_hz = 800)
}
\arguments{
\item{notes}{Vector of MIDI note numbers. Use 0 or NA for rests.}

\item{durations}{Vector of durations in 16th notes. 1 = 16th, 2 = 8th, 4 = quarter.}

\item{bpm}{Beats per minute (tempo)}

\item{velocity}{Velocity from 0.0 to 1.0 for all notes. Default 0.9.}

\item{cutoff_hz}{Lowpass filter cutoff frequency in Hz. Default 800.}
}
\value{
A Wave object containing the complete bass line
}
\description{
Sequences multiple bass notes into a bass line.
Handles rests (0 or NA) and variable note durations.
}
\details{
The notes and durations vectors must have the same length. Each note
is generated with the corresponding duration (converted from 16th notes
to seconds based on BPM). Rests are rendered as silence.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Classic house bass pattern: C2, rest, C3, C2
notes <- c(36, 0, 48, 36)
durations <- c(4, 4, 4, 4)  # All quarter notes
bass <- raver_bass_line(notes, durations, bpm = 120)

# Syncopated bass line
notes <- c(36, 0, 36, 48, 0, 36, 36, 48)
durations <- c(2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2, 2)  # All 8th notes
synco_bass <- raver_bass_line(notes, durations, bpm = 124)
}
