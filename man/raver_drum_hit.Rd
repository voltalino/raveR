\title{Trigger a drum hit with velocity scaling}
\usage{
raver_drum_hit(drum_type, velocity = 1, duration_sec = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{drum_type}{Character specifying the drum type: "kick", "snare",
"clap", "hihat_closed", or "hihat_open"}

\item{velocity}{Numeric velocity from 0.0 to 1.0, scales amplitude.
Default 1.0 (full velocity).}

\item{duration_sec}{Numeric duration in seconds. If NULL, uses full sample
length. If shorter than sample, truncates. If longer, pads with silence.}
}
\value{
A Wave object, or NULL if the sample is missing
}
\description{
Triggers a drum sample with velocity-based amplitude scaling.
Returns a Wave object that can be mixed with other instruments.
}
\details{
The velocity parameter scales the sample amplitude linearly.
A velocity of 0.5 produces half the amplitude, which is approximately
-6 dB. Missing samples return NULL with a warning rather than
throwing an error to allow graceful degradation.

\examples{
\dontrun{
kick <- raver_drum_hit("kick", velocity = 0.8)
snare <- raver_drum_hit("snare", velocity = 0.9)
soft_hihat <- raver_drum_hit("hihat_closed", velocity = 0.4)
}
