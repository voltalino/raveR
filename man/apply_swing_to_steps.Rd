\title{Apply swing to step positions}
\usage{
apply_swing_to_steps(steps, swing_amount)
}
\arguments{
\item{steps}{Numeric vector of step positions (1-indexed: 1, 2, 3, ...)}

\item{swing_amount}{Numeric swing amount from 0.0 to 0.25}
}
\value{
Numeric vector of adjusted step positions (may be fractional)
}
\description{
Adjusts a vector of step positions by applying swing to
even-numbered steps. The returned positions may be fractional.
}
\details{
This function is useful for converting step patterns to precise timing
before rendering. Even steps are delayed by swing_amount (as a fraction
of one step). Odd steps remain on grid.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Apply 10\% swing to steps 1-4
swung <- apply_swing_to_steps(1:4, 0.10)
# swung = c(1.0, 2.1, 3.0, 4.1)
}
