\title{Combine multiple patterns into one bar}
\usage{
combine_patterns(patterns, bpm, sample_rate = SAMPLE_RATE)
}
\arguments{
\item{patterns}{List of pattern objects created by create_pattern()}

\item{bpm}{Numeric beats per minute (tempo)}

\item{sample_rate}{Integer sample rate in Hz. Default SAMPLE_RATE.}
}
\value{
A Wave object containing all patterns mixed together
}
\description{
Renders multiple patterns and mixes them together into a single
Wave object. Normalizes the output to prevent clipping.
}
\details{
Each pattern is rendered independently, then all rendered patterns are
mixed together. The mix is normalized by dividing by sqrt(n_patterns)
to prevent clipping while maintaining relative loudness.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Create drum patterns
kick <- create_pattern("kick",
  c(T,F,F,F, T,F,F,F, T,F,F,F, T,F,F,F))
snare <- create_pattern("snare",
  c(F,F,F,F, T,F,F,F, F,F,F,F, T,F,F,F))
hihat <- create_pattern("hihat_closed", rep(TRUE, 16), swing = 0.08)

# Combine into groove
groove <- combine_patterns(list(kick, snare, hihat), bpm = 120)
}
