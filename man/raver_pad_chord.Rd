\title{Generate a pad chord}
\usage{
raver_pad_chord(
  root_midi,
  chord_type = "min9",
  duration_sec,
  velocity = 0.85,
  inversion = 0,
  reverb = TRUE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{root_midi}{MIDI note number for the chord root}

\item{chord_type}{Character name of chord type from CHORD_FORMULAS
(e.g., "min7", "maj7", "min9"). Default "min9".}

\item{duration_sec}{Duration in seconds}

\item{velocity}{Velocity from 0.0 to 1.0. Default 0.85 (increased for audibility).}

\item{inversion}{Chord inversion (0 = root position, 1 = first inversion, etc.).
Default 0.}

\item{reverb}{Logical, whether to apply reverb effect. Default TRUE.}
}
\value{
A Wave object containing the pad chord with reverb
}
\description{
Creates a warm pad chord by combining multiple pad notes.
Normalizes the output to prevent clipping from note stacking.
Automatically applies reverb for that classic deep house spacious sound.
}
\details{
The chord is built using raver_build_chord() to get MIDI notes,
then each note is rendered as a pad and mixed together. The mix
is normalized to prevent clipping from stacking multiple voices.
A master ADSR envelope is applied to the combined signal, and
reverb is added for the characteristic deep house pad sound.

\dontrun{
# Cmin9 pad, 4 seconds
chord <- raver_pad_chord(48, "min9", 4.0)

# Am7 in first inversion
chord_inv <- raver_pad_chord(57, "min7", 4.0, inversion = 1)
}
