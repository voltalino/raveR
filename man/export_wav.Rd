\title{Export to WAV File}
\usage{
export_wav(wave, filename, bit_depth = 16L)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A tuneR Wave object to export}

\item{filename}{Output filename. The .wav extension is added if missing.}

\item{bit_depth}{Bit depth for export (default: 16 for CD quality)}
}
\value{
The full path to the created file (invisibly)
}
\description{
Exports a Wave object to a WAV file. The audio is normalized to 16-bit
PCM format (CD quality) for maximum compatibility with audio players.
}
\details{
The Wave object is normalized using normalize_for_export() before writing.
This ensures proper amplitude scaling and bit depth conversion from the
32-bit float internal format to 16-bit PCM.

The file is written with extensible=FALSE for maximum compatibility with
audio players and software.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Generate and export a sine wave
tone <- raver_sine(440, 2)
path <- export_wav(tone, "my_tone.wav")
print(path)  # Full path to file

# Extension added automatically
path <- export_wav(tone, "my_tone")  # Creates my_tone.wav
}
