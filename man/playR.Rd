\description{
Starts continuous generative playback of deep house music derived from
an R script. The playback runs in the background while you continue to
work in R. If the script file is modified, the music will transition
smoothly to reflect the new code.
}
\details{
The playR() function starts a background playback loop that:
\itemize{
\item Analyzes your R script to extract code structure
\item Generates continuous deep house music based on the script
\item Monitors the script file for changes
\item Smoothly transitions the music when you modify and save the script
}

The R console remains interactive during playback. Use stopR() to halt
playback when you're done.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Start live playback
playR("my_analysis.R")

# Edit and save my_analysis.R - music will transition
# ...work on your code...

# Stop when done
stopR()

# With custom BPM
playR("my_analysis.R", bpm = 122)
}
}
