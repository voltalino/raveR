\title{Apply Bitcrush Effect}
\usage{
apply_bitcrush(wave, bit_reduction = 4L)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A tuneR Wave object to process}

\item{bit_reduction}{Integer number of bits to reduce. Default 4.
Higher values = more distortion.}
}
\value{
A modified Wave object with bitcrushing applied
}
\description{
Reduces effective bit depth to create lo-fi digital distortion. This quantizes
the audio samples to fewer levels, creating harsh harmonics and aliasing.
}
\details{
Bitcrushing works by quantizing the audio signal to fewer amplitude levels.
For example, reducing by 4 bits takes 16-bit audio (65536 levels) down to
effectively 12-bit (4096 levels), creating stair-stepped waveforms.

\examples{
\dontrun{
tone <- raver_sine(440, 2)

# Light crush
crushed_light <- apply_bitcrush(tone, bit_reduction = 2)

# Heavy crush (very lo-fi)
crushed_heavy <- apply_bitcrush(tone, bit_reduction = 8)
}
}
