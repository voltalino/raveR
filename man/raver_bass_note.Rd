\title{Generate a bass note}
\usage{
raver_bass_note(midi_note, duration_sec, velocity = 1, cutoff_hz = 800)
}
\arguments{
\item{midi_note}{MIDI note number (36 = C2, typical bass range 24-48)}

\item{duration_sec}{Duration in seconds}

\item{velocity}{Velocity from 0.0 to 1.0, scales amplitude. Default 1.0.}

\item{cutoff_hz}{Lowpass filter cutoff frequency in Hz. Default 800.}
}
\value{
A Wave object containing the bass note
}
\description{
Creates a filtered sawtooth bass note with ADSR envelope.
This is the core sound for deep house bass lines.
}
\details{
The bass sound uses a sawtooth wave as the source, which is rich in
harmonics. The lowpass filter removes high frequencies for a warm,
deep sound. The ADSR envelope (attack=0.005, decay=0.1, sustain=0.8,
release=0.1) provides a snappy attack with sustained body.

\dontrun{
# C2 bass note, 0.5 seconds
bass_note <- raver_bass_note(36, 0.5)

# A1 bass note with lower filter
deep_bass <- raver_bass_note(33, 1.0, cutoff_hz = 400)
}
