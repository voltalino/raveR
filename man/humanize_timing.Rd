\title{Add humanization to timing}
\usage{
humanize_timing(position_samples, amount = 0.02, seed = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{position_samples}{Integer sample position to humanize}

\item{amount}{Numeric maximum deviation as fraction of a 16th note at 120 BPM.
Default 0.02 (2\% of a 16th note, approximately 0.5ms).}

\item{seed}{Optional integer seed for deterministic random (reproducibility).
Default NULL uses non-deterministic random.}
}
\value{
Integer adjusted sample position
}
\description{
Adds subtle random variation to sample position for a more
human feel. The variation is constrained to avoid noticeable timing errors.
}
\details{
Humanization adds very small random offsets to make patterns feel less
robotic. The offset is uniformly distributed between -amount and +amount
of a 16th note duration (at reference 120 BPM).
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
# Humanize with deterministic seed
pos <- humanize_timing(44100, amount = 0.02, seed = 42)
}
