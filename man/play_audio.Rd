\usage{
play_audio(wave)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A tuneR Wave object to play}
}
\value{
An audioInstance object for playback control (invisibly)
}
\description{
Plays a Wave object through the system audio drivers. Playback is
asynchronous - the function returns immediately while audio plays
in the background. Use wait_audio() to block until playback completes.
}
\details{
Platform notes:
\itemize{
\item macOS: AudioUnits - works silently in background
\item Windows: Windows Multimedia - may open external player window
\item Linux: PortAudio - experimental, may require setup
}

The Wave object is normalized to \link{-1, 1} range for the audio package.
For 32-bit float input, this involves scaling by the max absolute value.
For 16-bit PCM input, this scales by 32768.

\dontrun{
# Play a 440 Hz sine wave
tone <- raver_sine(440, 1)
instance <- play_audio(tone)

# Wait for playback to complete
wait_audio(instance)

# Or play and stop early
tone <- raver_sine(440, 5)
play_audio(tone)
Sys.sleep(1)
stop_audio()
