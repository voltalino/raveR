\title{Pre-Rendered Buffer Architecture}
\description{
Functions for creating and managing pre-rendered audio buffers.
This architecture is critical for working around R's garbage collection
pauses (50-100ms) which would otherwise cause audio dropouts during
real-time playback. By pre-rendering complete buffers before playback,
GC pauses occur between buffer swaps rather than during audio output.
