\usage{
export_mp3(wave, filename, bitrate = 192000L)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A tuneR Wave object to export}

\item{filename}{Output filename. The .mp3 extension is added if missing.}

\item{bitrate}{Bitrate in bits per second (default: 192000 for 192 kbps)}
}
\value{
The full path to the created file (invisibly)
}
\description{
Exports a Wave object to an MP3 file. Requires FFmpeg to be installed
on the system. The audio is first exported to a temporary WAV file,
then converted to MP3 using av::av_audio_convert().
}
\details{
MP3 export requires FFmpeg with the lame codec. Use check_ffmpeg() to
verify availability before calling this function.

The default bitrate of 192 kbps provides good quality for most uses.
Higher bitrates (256000, 320000) provide better quality at larger file size.
Lower bitrates (128000, 96000) provide smaller files with reduced quality.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Check FFmpeg first
if (check_ffmpeg()) {
  tone <- raver_sine(440, 2)
  path <- export_mp3(tone, "my_tone.mp3")

  # With custom bitrate (320 kbps)
  path <- export_mp3(tone, "high_quality.mp3", bitrate = 320000L)
}
}
