\usage{
apply_stutter(wave, stutter_count = 5L, stutter_length_sec = 0.1, repeats = 3L)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A tuneR Wave object to process}

\item{stutter_count}{Integer number of stutter events. Default 5.}

\item{stutter_length_sec}{Numeric duration of each stutter segment in seconds.
Default 0.1.}

\item{repeats}{Integer number of times to repeat each segment (2-4). Default 3.}
}
\value{
A modified Wave object with stutter effect applied
}
\description{
Creates a stutter effect by repeating short segments of audio multiple times,
creating a rhythmic glitch pattern.
}
\details{
Stutter positions are chosen pseudo-randomly within the audio. Each stutter
replaces the following audio with repeated copies of the stutter segment.
This creates the characteristic "CD skip" or "digital glitch" sound.
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
tone <- raver_sine(440, 2)
stuttered <- apply_stutter(tone, stutter_count = 3, stutter_length_sec = 0.05)
