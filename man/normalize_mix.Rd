\title{Normalize mix to target headroom}
\usage{
normalize_mix(wave, headroom_db = -3)
}
\arguments{
\item{wave}{A Wave object to normalize}

\item{headroom_db}{Numeric target headroom in dB below full scale.
Default -3.0 dB (leaves 3 dB headroom).}
}
\value{
Normalized Wave object
}
\description{
Normalizes a Wave object so that the peak amplitude matches
a target headroom level. Prevents clipping while maximizing loudness.
}
\details{
The normalization process:
\enumerate{
\item Find the peak amplitude in the wave
\item Calculate the target peak level: 10^(headroom_db/20)
\item Scale the wave by target_peak / current_peak
}

For example, with headroom_db = -3.0:
\itemize{
\item Target peak = 10^(-3/20) = 0.708
\item If current peak is 1.5, scale by 0.708/1.5 = 0.472
}
}
\examples{
\dontrun{
mixed <- mix_tracks(tracks)
normalized <- normalize_mix(mixed, headroom_db = -3)
}
